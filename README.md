### Install dependencies for frontend and backend separately
**Tip:** To efficiently install dependencies for frontend, admin and backend simultaneously, use split terminals.

npm install
```

**Install admin dependencies**
```bash
cd starHR/admin
npm install
```

**Install backend dependencies**
```bash
cd starHR/backend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
**Backend**
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
- Add the following variables with appropriate values

```bash
MONGODB_URI = ''    
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = ""
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY = ""
CLOUDINARY_NAME = ""
```

**Frontend & Admin**
- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend & Admin` directory
- Add the following variable:
```bash
# Backend URL (adjust if needed)
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:4000" 
```

**Important**
- Replace all with your actual values.
- Exclude the `.env` file from version control to protect sensitive information.

**Important:**
- **Separate terminals**: Run the commands in separate terminal windows or use `split terminal` to avoid conflicts.
- **Nodemon required**: Ensure you have `nodemon` installed globally to run the backend development servers using `npm run dev`. You can install it globally using `npm install -g nodemon`.

#### Start the backend server
- Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
- Start the server: `npm run server`
- You should see a message indicating the server is running, usually on port 4000 or you can specify it in the PORT environment variable inside `.env` file.

#### Start the frontend server:
- Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
- Start the server: `npm run dev`

#### Start the admin server:
- Navigate to the `admin` directory: `cd admin`
- Start the server: `npm run dev`
